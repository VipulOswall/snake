# Android Snakes

 This is a project for learning where I created a simple snakes game.
 
 I would love to receive any suggestions / improvements.
 
## Getting Started

  These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

  Download the project on the local machine and then open it on Android Studio.
  
### Prerequisites

  - Git Version Control
  - Android Studio
  - JDK
  
### Installing

  Download the code with following command.
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/VipulOswall/snake
  ```
  Or by directly downloading it.
  There is come code to be fixed so this progam won't run

### Instructions

    The green field represents the game area where the game will be played. A snake appear on the screen and
    the controls are at the botton which represents the left and right of the snake.
    A insect on this field represents the food. Your objective 
    is to get the snake to the food and get the maximum score. As the snake eats the food, your score
    increases by 10. Next food item will appear randomly on screen. Use arrow keys to direct the snake 
    and help him get the food.
